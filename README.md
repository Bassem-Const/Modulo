# Modulo
A mod about modularity. (and environmental effects)

Every block will emit heat dependent on the type.

Heat will spreead through a 3d heat field.
That's just one fields of the  that are planned:
\n Heat (3d)
\nPressure (3d)
\nLiquid level/type (3d)
\nAltitude (2d) (genrated)
\nRadiation density (3d) (segregated into types (alpha/beta))
\nLead content (2.5d) (generated)
\nLuminosity (2d) (for solar panels)
