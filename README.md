# Modulo
A mod about modularity. (and environmental effects)

Every block will emit heat dependent on the type.

Heat will spread through a 3d heat field.

That's just one fields of the  that are planned:

  Heat (3d)

  Pressure (3d)

  Liquid level/type (3d)

  Altitude (2d) (genrated)

  Radiation density (3d) (segregated into types (alpha/beta))

  Lead content (2.5d) (generated)

  Luminosity (2d) (for solar panels)
